# `cocoapods-generate`

A [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) plugin that allows you to easily generate a workspace from a podspec.

Whether you want to completely remove all Xcode projects from your library's repository or you want to be able to focus on a small piece of a monorepo, a single `pod gen` command will build up a workspace suitable for writing, running, testing, and debugging in Xcode.

When you're done working, you don't have to do anything -- and that means no merge conflicts, no managing Xcode projects, and no tearing down a sample app setup. `pod gen` manages all that for you.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'cocoapods-generate'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install cocoapods-generate

## CLI

The main point of interaction with the plugin is via the `pod gen` command.
It takes in a list of podspecs (or directories) as arguments,
as well as many options that modify how `gen` will create your workspace.

```
Usage:

    $ pod gen [PODSPEC|DIR ...]

      Generates Xcode workspaces from a podspec.

      pod gen allows you to keep your Podfile and podspecs as the single source of
      truth for pods under development. By generating throw-away workspaces capable of
      building, running, and testing a pod, you can focus on library development
      without worrying about other code or managing an Xcode project.

      pod gen works particularly well for monorepo projects, since it is capable of
      using your existing settings when generating the workspace, making each gen'ed
      project truly a small slice of the larger application.

<!-- end cli usage -->

## `.gen_config.yml`

All of the command line options above can also be specified in a `.gen_config.yml` file.

For example, the equivalent of running `pod gen --no-deterministic-uuids --sources=a,b --gen-directory=/tmp/gen --use-libraries` would be

```yaml
deterministic_uuids: false
sources:
- a
- b
gen_directory: /tmp/gen
use_libraries: true
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bin/rake spec` to run the tests.

You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.

To release a new version, update the version number in `VERSION`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
